# Game-to-be-named

Welcome to the first Ostrich-Games game. This readme needs to be filled in.

To clone and work on this repo do the following:

1. Download [Git|https://git-scm.com/download/win]

2. (Optional) Download [Sourcetree|https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/] this is a gui for the Git workflow
    while it is not necessary I recommend it as its a lot easier than using the command line to clone
	and contribute.

3. Clone the repo, whether by the command line or by adding the repo in sourcetree

4. Download Visual Studio 2017

5. Work away, the git workflow and pull requests are used to upload changes back into this repo. You 
   will not be able to push work straight to the master branch so create a branch and then pull request
   it into master once your work on the branch has reached an appropriate point.

There may be further steps in the future once I initialise the main game loop and sort out using cmake 
to build the visual studio solution.
